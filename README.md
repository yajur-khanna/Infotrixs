        fuel (int): Remaining fuel percentage for the spacecraft.
        resources (int): Available resources collected during the journey.
        planet_distances (dict): Distances between planets for calculating travel costs.

    Methods:
        _init_(): Constructor method initializing the SpaceExplorer object.
        calculate_planet_distances(): Calculates distances between planets for travel.
        display_status(): Displays the current status of the explorer, including planet, fuel, and resources.
        travel_to_planet(destination_planet): Initiates travel to the specified destination planet.
        explore_planet(): Allows the explorer to choose activities on the current planet.
        visit_mountains(): Simulates visiting the mountains on the current planet.
        search_for_life(): Searches for signs of life on the current planet.
        collect_resources(): Collects resources on the current planet.
        calculate_fuel_cost(start_planet, end_planet): Calculates the fuel cost for traveling between two planets.
        refuel_with_resources(): Refuels the spacecraft using collected resources.
